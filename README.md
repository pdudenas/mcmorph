# MCMorph
Collection of Monte Carlo-based algorithms for procedural morphology generation. Also includes some legacy functionality to reduce 4DSTEM and HRTEM data.

Current functionality
1. Monte Carlo crystal growth. Can be used to heal gaps in STEM data or create syntheic morphologies
2. Monte Carlo fiber growth. Orthorhombic or helically varying dielectric functions can be mapped to fibers
3. Translate semi-reduced 4DSTEM & HRTREM data (I vs. q and chi)
